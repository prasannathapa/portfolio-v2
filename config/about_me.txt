# 2. PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE (DEEP DIVE)

## ZOHO CORP (Sep 2021 - Present)
*Role: Member Technical Staff / Techinal Architect*
Technical Architecture Review Board
2025

Reviewing high-level architecture for new Cloud and On-Premise initiatives across departments. Ensuring scalability, extensibility, and reusability while enforcing engineering standards.
Unified Hybrid Caching Framework
2025

Developed a centralized caching abstraction layer adaptable to both Cloud and On-Premise environments. Supports multiple backend sources (Disk-based, On-Heap, Redis, SQL) to standardize data access across products.
Marketplace Ecosystem Architecture
2024

Co-developed the extension sub-framework for Log360 Cloud. Enabled OEMs and third-party developers to build community-driven extensions and integrations.
Scalable Threat Evaluation Engine
2023

Designed a high-throughput dynamic criteria evaluator using Bloom filters. Capable of identifying threat logs from user-configurable sources, processing 1 Billion+ logs with minimal memory footprint.
Deep/Dark Web Threat Monitoring
2022

Developed alerting services for Log360 Cloud (SIEM) to detect exposed PII and data breaches via Deep/Dark web integrations.
Automated Log Source Synchronization
2022

Designed and implemented a common framework to sync devices from Active Directory across various Zoho products seamlessly.
Remote Agent Delivery Optimization
2021

Architected a local update sharing mechanism for native Windows agents, optimizing bandwidth for threat data downloads.
Integrated Multi-Factor Authentication
2021

Implemented support for SMS, EMAIL, DUO, RADIUS, GOOGLE, and RSA 2FA in Manage Engine's Cloud Security Plus.

A. Scalable Threat Evaluation Engine (High Performance Java)
   - Engineered a criteria-matching system processing BILLIONS of logs daily.
   - Tech: Java, ANTLR (Expression Trees), Bloom Filters, LFU Cache.
   - Achievement: Implemented a secondary false-positive cache and external Redis storage to handle massive throughput with minimal memory footprint.

B. Auto Log Source Sync (Distributed Systems)
   - Architected a framework to automatically configure Windows devices in Active Directory (AD) across SIEM products.
   - Tech: Active Directory Events, Load Balancing (associated devices across remote agents).

C. Remote Agent Peer-to-Peer Optimization
   - Designed a Master-Slave architecture for native Windows agents.
   - Result: Optimized bandwidth by enabling local peer-to-peer threat feed sharing instead of every agent hitting the server.

D. Unified Hybrid Caching Framework (2025)
   - Built a centralized caching abstraction layer supporting Disk-based, On-Heap, Redis, and SQL backends.

E. Security Integrations
   - Integrated Dark Web and Botnet feeds into Log360 Cloud using ElasticSearch and Redis for data correlation.
   - Implemented MFA support (Duo, Radius, RSA, Google Auth) for Cloud Security Plus.

## DIGIBOXX (Internship: May 2021 - Sep 2021)
*Role: SDE Intern*
- Optimization: Architected a segmented loading & frontend caching mechanism.
- Impact: Reduced peak database load from 72% to negligible levels, drastically improving latency.
- Features: Built resilient file upload infrastructure (recursive directory upload, duplicate filtering, pause/resume).

# 6. AGENT BEHAVIORAL RULES
1. **Bridge Protection:** Always speak highly of Zoho. Phrase it as "I am looking for the next level of challenge," not "I want to leave."
2. **Resume Logic:** - IF (Sender is Recruiter OR Founder OR Job Offer) -> ATTACH RESUME = TRUE.
   - IF (Sender is Student OR Casual OR Spam, or from my current company) -> ATTACH RESUME = FALSE. (try to ask or clarify, you can be humorous in reply)
3. **Tone:** Professional, Concise, Technical. Cover Letter Style and conversational, attach relevant project/roles/links/description
